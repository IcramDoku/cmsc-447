#### Description: This is my CRUD web application using React, Flask, Python, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It is a simple student registration app.

## Directions for running this app:

1. From the terminal inside the `/backend` directory, run `python3 app.py` on macOS. For Windows using VS Code, simply open app.py and run it by choosing `Run Python File`.
   
2. From the terminal inside the `/frontend` directory, run `npm install` to pull in all the necessary packages.
   
3. You can start the UI by running `npm start` in the same directory.
